# How to use
This program heavily rely on Tradingview scripting and alarming system, it basically works as glue between our script on Tradingview to an exchange.

So to use this program, you will need to upload the PineScript in the repo to Tradingview, setup and alarm system, and then put your email credential in the program so it can read alarm and excute trades

To start the program, simply run loop.py

I know the program looks poorly structured, I'll work on the refactored version soon
